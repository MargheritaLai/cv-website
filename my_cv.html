        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I am Margherita and I am a software developer. I chose Biomedical Engineering and Neuroengineering as my
            degree courses, because I've always been very interested in every aspect of the human brain. I'm fascinated by its incredible
            complexity. This course of study opened the doors to programming which I immediately fell in love with.
            In my professional experience I have a great deal of initiative, determination, and I'm very meticulous and precise in my job
            duties. I'm constantly looking for new challenges, therefore I love a dynamic and varied environment to work in. No matter
            where I work, I always make time to improve my knowledge and skill set. In these last few years, I understood that the
            important thing in my job is being happy and satisfied about what I do every day and being excited about what will happen
            tomorrow.
